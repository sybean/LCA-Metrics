# LCA-Metrics

This is a tool for pulling data from Lot-Casting Atemi using browser automation.
To run it, you'll need Selenium's Google Chrome drivers.

I built this for a couple reasons:
- As an excuse to play with Selenium
- So that I could do silly things like find the average Strength of characters
- As the foundation for  a tool to help Storytellers set encounter difficulty
